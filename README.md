## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **Spotify Clone** - my very first project as a beginner! This is a simple, responsive **frontend clone** of the Spotify web interface, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project mimics the core functionality of Spotifyâ€™s layout and design, with features like:
- Responsive navigation bar
- Playlist cards
- Album and track displays
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

## ðŸ“¸ **Website Preview**


The project is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across all devices:

- **Desktop**: The main navigation bar, playlist cards, and song player controls are all visible on larger screens.

- **Mobile**: The layout adapts to smaller screens, with a hide/unhide sidebar and a simplified layout for better usability on mobile devices.
